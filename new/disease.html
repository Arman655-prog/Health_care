    <p>Dengue (break-bone fever) is a viral infection that spreads from mosquitoes to people. It is more common in
        tropical and subtropical climates. Dengue is found in tropical and sub-tropical climates worldwide, mostly in
        urban and semi-urban areas. While many dengue infections are asymptomatic or produce only mild illness, the
        virus can occasionally cause more severe cases, and even death.</p>

    <h3>Symptoms</h3>
    <p>Most people with dengue have mild or no symptoms. If symptoms occur, they usually begin 4–10 days after infection
        and last for 2–7 days. Symptoms may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>High fever (40°C/104°F)</li>
        <li>Severe headache</li>
        <li>Pain behind the eyes</li>
        <li>Muscle and joint pains</li>
        <li>Nausea</li>
        <li>Vomiting</li>
        <li>Swollen glands</li>
        <li>Rash</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Individuals who are infected for the second time are at greater risk of severe dengue. Severe dengue symptoms
        often come after the fever has gone away:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Severe abdominal pain</li>
        <li>Persistent vomiting</li>
        <li>Rapid breathing</li>
        <li>Bleeding gums or nose</li>
        <li>Fatigue</li>
        <li>Restlessness</li>
        <li>Blood in vomit or stool</li>
        <li>Being very thirsty</li>
        <li>Pale and cold skin</li>
        <li>Feeling weak</li>
    </ul>
    <p>People with these severe symptoms should get care right away.</p>

    <h3>Common Treatments</h3>
    <p>There is no specific medicine to treat dengue infection. If you think you may have dengue fever, take pain
        relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol). Avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin
        and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), which could worsen bleeding. Rest and drink plenty of fluids to prevent
        dehydration.</p>

    <h3>Preventions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Use mosquito repellents, even indoors.</li>
        <li>When outdoors, wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants tucked into socks.</li>
        <li>When indoors, use air conditioning if available.</li>
        <li>Make sure the window and door screens are secure and free of holes. If sleeping areas are not screened or
            air-conditioned, use mosquito nets.</li>
        <li>To reduce the mosquito population, get rid of places where mosquitoes can breed. These include old tires,
            cans, or flower pots that collect rain.</li>
    </ul>

        <h2 id="malaria">Malaria</h2>
        <img 
        src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/29232960/pexels-photo-29232960/free-photo-of-child-advocating-against-malaria-in-abuja.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=600" 
        alt="..." 
        style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
    
        <p>Malaria is a life-threatening disease spread to humans by some types of mosquitoes. It is mostly found in
            tropical countries. Malaria mostly spreads to people through the bites of some infected female Anopheles
            mosquitoes. Blood transfusion and contaminated needles may also transmit malaria.</p>

        <h3>Symptoms</h3>
        <p>The most common early symptoms of malaria are fever, headache, and chills. Symptoms usually start within
            10–15 days of getting bitten by an infected mosquito. Symptoms may be mild for some people, especially for
            those who have had a malaria infection before. Severe symptoms include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Extreme tiredness and fatigue</li>
            <li>Impaired consciousness</li>
            <li>Multiple convulsions</li>
            <li>Difficulty breathing</li>
            <li>Dark or bloody urine</li>
            <li>Jaundice (yellowing of the eyes and skin)</li>
            <li>Abnormal bleeding</li>
        </ul>
        <p>People with severe symptoms should get emergency care right away. Getting treatment early for mild malaria
            can stop the infection from becoming severe.</p>

        <h3>Common Treatments</h3>
        <p>Early diagnosis and treatment of malaria reduces disease, prevents deaths, and contributes to reducing
            transmission. WHO recommends that all suspected cases of malaria be confirmed using parasite-based
            diagnostic testing (through either microscopy or a rapid diagnostic test).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Artemisinin-based combination therapy medicines are the most effective treatment for P. falciparum
                malaria.</li>
            <li>Chloroquine is recommended for treatment of infection with the P. vivax parasite only in places where it
                is still sensitive to this medicine.</li>
            <li>Primaquine should be added to the main treatment to prevent relapses of infection with the P. vivax and
                P. ovale parasites.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Most medicines used are in pill form. Some people may need to go to a health centre or hospital for
            injectable medicines.</p>

        <h3>Prevention</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Use mosquito nets when sleeping in places where malaria is present.</li>
            <li>Use mosquito repellents (containing DEET, IR3535, or Icaridin) after dusk.</li>
            <li>Use coils and vaporizers.</li>
            <li>Wear protective clothing.</li>
            <li>Use window screens.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="tuber">Tuberculosis (TB)</h2>
        <img 
        src="https://media.istockphoto.com/id/468719560/photo/pulmonary-tuberculosis.jpg?b=1&s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=p2-EICZdVhAJl14jNMFOPoAiLw8lDvhpDK6t9StkTjw=" 
        alt="..." 
        style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
    
        <p>TB is caused by bacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) and it most often affects the lungs. TB is spread
            through the air when people with lung TB cough, sneeze, or spit. A person needs to inhale only a few germs
            to become infected. People infected with TB bacteria have a 5–10% lifetime risk of falling ill with TB.
            Those with compromised immune systems, such as people living with HIV, malnutrition or diabetes, or people
            who use tobacco, have a higher risk of falling ill.</p>

        <h3>Symptoms</h3>
        <p>Common symptoms of TB disease include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Prolonged cough</li>
            <li>Chest pain</li>
            <li>Weakness or fatigue</li>
            <li>Weight loss</li>
            <li>Fever</li>
            <li>Night sweats</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Often, these symptoms will be mild for many months, thus leading to delays in seeking care and increasing the
            risk of spreading the infection to others. A person gets infected with TB bacteria that lie inactive in the
            body. This infection can develop into TB disease if their immune system weakens. People with TB infection do
            not show any signs or symptoms of TB.</p>

        <h3>Common Treatments</h3>
        <p>It is treated by a standard 6-month course of 4 antibiotics. Common drugs include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Isoniazid</li>
            <li>Rifampicin</li>
            <li>Pyrazinamide</li>
            <li>Ethambutol</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To be effective, medications need to be taken daily for 4–6 months. It is dangerous to stop the medications
            early or without medical advice as it can prompt TB bacteria in the body to become resistant to the drugs.
        </p>

        <h3>Prevention</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Seek medical attention if you have symptoms like prolonged cough, fever, and unexplained weight loss as
                early treatment for TB can help stop the spread of disease and improve your chances of recovery.</li>
            <li>Get tested for TB if you are at increased risk, such as if you have HIV or are in contact with people
                who have TB in your household or workplace.</li>
            <li>TB preventive treatment (or TPT) prevents infection from becoming disease. If prescribed TPT, complete
                the full course.</li>
            <li>If you have TB, practice good hygiene when coughing, including avoiding contact with other people and
                wearing a mask, covering your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, and disposing of sputum and used
                tissues properly.</li>
            <li>Special measures like respirators and ventilation are important to reduce infection in healthcare
                facilities and other institutions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="thalass">Thalassemia</h2>
        <img 
        src="https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1824435732/photo/blood-sampling-tube.jpg?b=1&s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=P3NDWS7zKlqN-Zk8TCAIQefOgZ8O838Vm88I4n8T5Os=" 
        alt="..." 
        style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
    
        <p>Thalassemia is a genetic blood disorder characterized by the body’s inability to produce enough healthy
            hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. This leads to anemia (low red blood cell
            count) and other complications.</p>

        <h3>Symptoms</h3>
        <p>The symptoms of thalassemia vary depending on the type of thalassemia. In infants with beta thalassemia and
            some types of alpha thalassemia, symptoms usually appear after the age of 6 months. This is because neonates
            have a different type of hemoglobin called fetal hemoglobin. Symptoms may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Jaundice and pale skin</li>
            <li>Drowsiness and fatigue</li>
            <li>Chest pain</li>
            <li>Shortness of breath</li>
            <li>Rapid heartbeat</li>
            <li>Delayed growth</li>
            <li>Dizziness and faintness</li>
            <li>Greater susceptibility to infection</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Common Treatments</h3>
        <p>Treatment depends on the type and severity of thalassemia. Options include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Blood transfusions:</strong> People with thalassemia major will need between eight and 12
                transfusions a year. Those with less severe thalassemia will need up to eight transfusions each year or
                more in times of stress, illness, or infection.</li>
            <li><strong>Iron chelation:</strong> This involves removing excess iron from the bloodstream. Deferoxamine
                is prescribed, a medication given by injection under the skin or into the muscle.</li>
            <li><strong>Surgery:</strong> This may be necessary to correct bone abnormalities.</li>
        </ul>
